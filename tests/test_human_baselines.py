"""The human comparisons come from the workbook's column, and only from it.

The failure this guards against has happened twice on this dashboard, both
times because a number arrived without the question it answered. Graph 2 grew
catastrophe "anchors" nobody asked for (project lead, 2026-08-18), and Graph 1
carried XPT medians beside questions whose wording had moved under them
("these don't match"). Both looked like data and were editorial.

So the chain is checked end to end rather than trusted: her "Human comparisons
(Project)" column says which question x horizon cells have a human panel and
which panel; the generator carries that into each question's
`human_comparisons`; code/fetch_human_baselines.py pulls those and only those.
Every test below asserts one link of that chain, and the strongest of them is
test_no_baseline_the_workbook_did_not_ask_for.

"""The question files must be generated, never edited. This is what enforces it.

Project lead, 2026-08-17: the data source that hydrates all of the language on
the dashboard must be the same one that hydrates what the superforecasters were
asked and what the models are asked, so the two can never come apart.

A promise like that decays the first time someone fixes a typo in the JSON
instead of in the source files. test_generated_files_are_current is the whole
guarantee: regenerate from data/auto-arc/ and diff byte-for-byte against what is
tracked. Hand-edit either file and the build fails, naming the file.

The rest of the tests here guard the SHAPE of the set, because the generator
reads a spreadsheet someone else maintains. A renamed sheet column or a dropped
row would otherwise produce a smaller, perfectly valid-looking question set, and
the dashboard would quietly plot less than it claims to.

    The generator is the one place where hardcoding is most tempting and least
    visible — it is a build step, so a typed-in value looks derived. The first

    catastrophe threshold rather than parsing "10% of population" from the
    Severity column, and it invented display names ("AI-enabled epidemic" for
    her "AI-related human-caused epidemic") and template phrases.

    None of those would have been caught by the threshold-literal ban, which
    only reads page source. These tests read the generator's OUTPUT back

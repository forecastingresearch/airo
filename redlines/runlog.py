"""Forecast run-log loading: results/forecast_runs.jsonl + results/runs/*.jsonl.

Ported from code/make_demo_graph1.py::load_runlog, with a defensive read guard
applied to every row's `forecasts` field before it's handed back — the
semantics of the inline timeline script's forecasts_of (ported 2026-08-13) and
archive/legacy-questions/run_forecasts.py::clean_forecasts, ported here so
every caller (graph1, graph2, timeline, and whatever views come next) gets the
same protection without repeating it.

WHY THE GUARD EXISTS
A 2026-08-10 bug had a model (Fable 5) hand back its forecast array as a
truthy, malformed JSON *string* instead of a parsed list. `if not
row["forecasts"]:` doesn't catch that (a non-empty string is truthy), so
naive iteration over row["forecasts"] treats the string as an iterable of
1-character strings and crashes on the first `f["horizon"]` lookup.
run_forecasts.py::clean_forecasts stops new rows like this from landing; this
guard makes every *read* of the existing log safe regardless.

GUARANTEE
Every row this module returns has row["forecasts"] as a (possibly empty)
list of dicts. This does not change what the current materializers compute
from the current run log: the one malformed historical row is for
("16. State Actor Bioweapon 1k Deaths", "Fable 5") on 2026-08-10, and is
always shadowed by a later, well-formed row for the same (question, model)
key — so it never survives latest_per() or the per-day dedup either way.

draws the same one.

Graph 1 and the Timeline both rail the whole question set grouped by the

what each category is called, and on each rung's label. They drifted once
already (Graph 1 listed one rung per incident while Graph 2 drew eight; the two
graphs named the same causes differently). This module is the single source for
all three, built from the ladder spec, so a question-set change relabels every

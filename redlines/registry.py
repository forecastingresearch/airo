"""redlines.registry — the single model table: ids, labels, ECI, colors, architecture.

Before this module the model set was defined in five places under five naming
conventions:

  code/eci_scores.py     DEMO_MODEL_SET (9) + GAP_FILLERS (2) + ALT_HIGH_ANCHOR (1)
  archive/legacy-questions/run_forecasts.py  MODELS -- the frontier five
  code/make_demo_graph1.py  MODEL_COLORS      -- frontier-five display colors
  code/pandemic_smoke.py    SMOKE_MODELS      -- hand-typed ECI integers (!)
  code/make_demo_graph3.py  DASH_MODELS       -- ForecastBench display names

MODELS below is the union: one row per distinct model, tagged with every role
it plays. ECI is always looked up from a dated snapshot of the official Epoch
Capabilities Index by epoch_name at import time -- never hand-copied
(docs/model-set.md). Which snapshots exist, which is newest and how old it is
are redlines.eci's business; this module only says which vintage each number
comes from.

THE MODEL PANEL (since 2026-08-28) is not a hand-typed list. It is the
PANEL_K highest-ECI models in the NEWEST snapshot that this table can run
(panel()), re-ranked every time it is asked for -- the rule measured in
~/Projects/forecastbench-ensembling (docs/eci-top4-arm.md): average the top
3-4 by ECI; the specific list goes stale fast, so never inherit one. The
hand-typed frontier five survive as the named set `frontier5`, the panel the
series ran on until then.

#   "dense"        -- publicly documented dense transformer (Llama-3.3-70B's
#                      model card).
#   "distilled"    -- publicly documented distillation from a larger teacher.
#                      No row uses this today; reserved for when one does.
#   "undisclosed"  -- every closed-vendor model (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/xAI):
#                      the lab has not published architecture details. This is
#                      not "we didn't check" -- it's the honest label for
#                      "the vendor keeps it private."
#
# TODO.md Phase 2's Graph-4 subset rule (redlines/views/graph4.py build()):
# the CLEAN SUBSET excludes architecture in {"moe", "distilled"} -- i.e.
# architectures known to behave differently from a plain dense transformer,
# which is a real confound for a capability-vs-skill trend line -- and keeps
# "dense" + "undisclosed". "undisclosed" stays IN the clean subset: absence of
# a public architecture claim is not evidence of a confounded one, and
# excluding on suspicion rather than fact would just be guessing with extra
# steps.
#
# colors: the frontier five's are the fixed categorical assignments from
# code/make_demo_graph1.py's MODEL_COLORS, CVD-validated against the demo's
# light panel; the 2026-08-28 panel members got theirs with the ECI top-4 arm.
# Every other row carries a muted spare so that, the day the index ranks it
# into the panel, the views can draw it -- none of those has been drawn yet,
# and they are chosen only to sit apart from the eight above and from the
# cause palette (CATEGORIES, data/autoarc_ladder.json).
# family: the line whose versions supersede one another, for the panel's
# within-family rule (project lead, 2026-09-08: skip Fable 5 when Fable 5.1
# is seated). One seat per family, the highest-ranked member takes it. The
# assignment is by hand and is a judgement: Claude's tiers (Fable, Opus,
# Sonnet, Haiku) are separate lines; OpenAI's plain GPT-n are one line, the
# Pro tier another, and the code-named GPT-5.6 Sol / GPT-6 Astra each their
# own -- so the 2026-09-08 panel seats Astra beside GPT-5.5 Pro. Fold two

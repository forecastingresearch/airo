"""The ECI-ranked roster the two conditional benches ran on: data/causal/models.csv.

Twenty-four models, every one reachable through OpenRouter, ranked by the
Epoch Capabilities Index as Epoch published it on 2026-08-27 (the `eci`
column; code/causal/model_scores.csv is the list it was resolved from). It is
the roster of the causal bench's locked dataset (data/causal/README.md) and,
since 2026-08-28, of the observational bench's roster run
(code/observational/run_roster.py) -- one x-axis for both "Why trust this?"
conditional charts.

ECI VINTAGE. This is a third vintage next to the two redlines.eci manages:
Graph 4 is pinned to 2026-07-07 and the panel is chosen from the newest
snapshot (a leaderboard top-17 that does not reach the roster's weaker
models). The roster's values are part of the locked dataset -- re-deriving
them from a later snapshot would move a published headline (the causal
rho) -- so they are read from the dataset and never recomputed. The
difference is small (Fable 5: 162.49 here, 162 in the 2026-08-28 snapshot)
and is stated on the charts.

Labels are the dashboard's (redlines.registry) where the model is in the
registry, so the same model reads the same everywhere; the rest are the
OpenRouter display names without the vendor prefix.

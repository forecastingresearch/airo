"""Paper Figure: what the level of frontier capability does to a forecast
(the Capability tab), from results/capability_data.json.

The same chart as conditional.py -- one panel per horizon, one row per
condition, ensemble ratio as a bar and per-model dots -- on the
default variant's rows. Conditions are the model's OWN percentiles of the
frontier ECI at the target date (Step 1 of the prompt asks for them), so a
row label names the percentile and the ensemble's level for it.

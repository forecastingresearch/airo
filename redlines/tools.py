"""Grounding tools the forecasting models can call during a tool-use run.

VENDORED on 2026-08-28 from xrisk-canaries' `forecast/cruxgen/tools.py` -- see
redlines/llm.py for why the move happened. Pure stdlib: urllib against Tavily,
no third-party client.

Each tool is a dict {name, description, parameters (JSON schema), fn} -- the shape
redlines.llm.call_tools expects. `fn(**args)` returns a JSON-serializable result
that is both fed back to the model AND captured into the forecast event's
evidence[], so every grounded forecast is auditable (and, later, replayable from
the snapshot).

TWO tools since 2026-09-02: `web_search` (Tavily search) and `read_page` (Tavily
extract: the text of one page, served in windows). Together they are what
"iterative multi-step search" means here -- search, read the results that
matter, search again on what they said -- and the runner's prompt asks for
exactly that (code/run_unified.py SYSTEM / PROMPT_JOINT). Web search is shared
(one Tavily backend for every model) so the model comparison isn't confounded
by each provider's native search.

Tools degrade gracefully: a missing key returns an error result rather than
raising, so a run without the key still completes (ungrounded) -- which is
exactly why run_unified.py refuses to start without TAVILY_API_KEY rather than
trusting this fallback.

METACULUS_LOOKUP -- REMOVED 2026-09-02. Until then the toolset carried a third
tool, `metaculus_lookup`, which searched Metaculus's API for an open question
matching the topic and handed the model its community median as a "cross-check
(never copy it)". It arrived with the vendored code: the canaries project used
it to sanity-anchor low-probability forecasts against a public crowd, and the
first Redlines runs kept it for the same reason. On 2026-08-31 the FRI
economist objected to giving the models a Metaculus-specific search and it
was taken out: on these questions the lookup mostly surfaces
Metaculus's own long-horizon catastrophe questions, so what it hands the model
is a number to anchor on rather than evidence -- which makes "the model's
estimate" partly a copy of the crowd's, privileges one platform over every
other source a search could reach, and (docs/methodology.md, Graph 3) reads
the very community prices a prospective benchmark withholds. It bought critique
without buying information. Rows elicited with it carry protocol tags up to
`unified-joint-combined-v1`; the code is in git history (this file before
2026-09-02) and needed METACULUS_API_KEY, which redlines.llm no longer loads.
The paper tells the same story in its methods section.

# --- Question-set constants retired by the Auto-ARC swap (2026-08-18) --------
#
# STABLE_SUBSET is gone. It named the four XPT questions (9./10./3./4.) that
# were confirmed to survive the Auto-ARC question-set rewrite, so the scheduled
# job could build a series that the swap would not throw away. Two of the four
# did not survive: #9 and #3 carry over intact as the general and AI catastrophe
# questions, at the same 10%-of-population threshold, but the Auto-ARC set has no
# extinction question at all, so #10 and #4 have no successor. Human
# disempowerment replaces the concept and starts from nothing.
#
# BATCH_CAUSE is gone too. It mapped an XPT question's category to a ladder
# cause so the runner could file it under one. The Auto-ARC set needs no such
# map: every ladder question already names its own cause, and the three
# cross-cutting questions belong to no cause by design.
#
# UNBATCHED survives, with different contents and the same reason: a question
# belongs in the joint call only if it shares the others' context.
#   p6bio:* -- the four P6-bio comparison rows sit at 2045 on a deaths-only
#     severity, so they share neither the ladder's horizon grid nor its
#     disjunctive threshold. They exist to line up with an existing human panel
#     and are elicited separately, the way XPT #2 was.

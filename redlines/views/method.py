"""The METHOD blob: the elicitation as the FAQ shows it (web/demo/79-faq.jsx).

Two things the "How do you elicit the forecasts?" and "Which models are in
the ensemble?" answers render live instead of by hand:

  * the whole prompt -- the system prompt and the single-instrument user
    prompt (code/run_unified.py build_prompt_joint, the published COMBINED
    condition set, every question x horizon cell) -- rebuilt from the same
    question and condition files the cron reads, so the page shows what the
    models are actually sent. The prompt is dated: "Today is ..." and the
    rolling horizons' resolves-on dates come from the day. Here that day is
    the LATEST RUN's run_date in the runlog, not the wall clock, so the blob
    is a function of the tracked data alone (the golden tests rebuild it and
    compare bytes) and reads as the prompt the latest forecasts answered.

  * the panel -- redlines.registry.panel_provenance(): the k highest-ECI
    runnable models in the newest tracked ECI snapshot, the selection the
    next run makes. age_days is left out (wall clock).

code/run_unified.py is a script, not a package module; it is loaded the way
tests/test_conditional.py loads it.

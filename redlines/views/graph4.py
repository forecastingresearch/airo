"""Graph 4 (two-sim ECI panel): blob builder.

Ported from code/make_demo_combined.py -- the lead author's original Graph-4 design
(per-model calibration curves + Brier skill), fed the TWO-SIM AVERAGE. For
each model, pools its forecasts from BOTH simulators, weighting each
simulator EQUALLY (so it's an average, not a count-weighted pool):
  - CivBench (FreeCiv): H2-H4 horizon x 5-9% base-rate subset of the full eval.
  - Starsim pandemic: the deaths-threshold smoke (per-question preds).
Where only one simulator scored a model, that one is used.

Pure: build() takes already-resolved input paths and returns the blob dict --
no argparse, no file writes, no hydration (the code/make_demo_combined.py
shim does all three, preserving R0's rewire to redlines.hydrate.inject).

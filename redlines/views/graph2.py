"""Graph 2: the severity ladder, and the coherence check that needs no resolution.

Four AI incident types, eight rungs each, one wording per cause with the
threshold as the only variable — so every curve spans the whole severity axis
and causes are directly comparable at equal severity.

TWO THINGS CHANGED SHAPE IN THE AUTO-ARC SWAP, and both are visible here.

Cyber is on the ladder. It was held out by design while the axis was
deaths-only (per the paper's lead author, 2026-08-03: cyber belongs on a
DAMAGES ladder). Every Auto-ARC rung resolves on deaths OR damages, at the $10M
value of a statistical life its criteria state, so the two legs are exactly
convertible and cyber sits on the same axis as the rest.

The container is "any AI-related incident", not "all causes". The set's
definition makes that class contain the other three, so it plays the role the
old slate "All causes" curve played. But it is NOT an all-cause ceiling —
nuclear and natural pandemics are outside this question set entirely — so the
CROSS check it anchors is AI-internal. That is a real narrowing and the panel
says so rather than letting the slate curve imply a totality it does not have.

The two catastrophe questions are drawn as ANCHORS on the severity axis at
their 10%-of-population equivalent, about 820M deaths, between the 100M and 1B
rungs. They are not rungs: a population share floats as population changes
while the rungs stay fixed, and it has no damages leg. They are our own live
forecasts, so unlike the retired XPT markers they move between runs.

Coherence is REPORTED here, never enforced. The prompt states no relation
between these questions (code/run_unified.py), so a violation is a measurement.

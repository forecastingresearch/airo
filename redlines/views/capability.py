"""Capability tab: the frontier ECI -- history, the models' own forecast of it,
metr_graph's trend -- and every question conditional on the models' own
capability worlds.

Project lead, 2026-08-28: a tab called "Capability" with two graphs. (1) The
historical ECI trend plus the forecasted p50 / p25 / p75. (2) The questions
conditional on progress -- IDENTICAL to the Policy-levers graph except that
the rows are the model's own 25th / 50th / 75th percentile worlds instead of
policies, with the same unconditional line ("we expect p50 in the
unconditional").

Two self-elicited instruments exist (docs/conditional-forecasts.md):
data/eci_self6mo_conditions.json (frontier ECI six months from the run date)
and data/eci_self_conditions.json (end of 2030); the tab shows the six-month
one only for now (project lead, 2026-08-28) -- VARIANTS is the switch. Each is one
variant here:
its ECI forecast per model and call, the trend at its target date, and its
conditional cells shaped exactly as the policy tab's by
redlines.views.conditional._variant -- same arithmetic, same JSON shape, so
the page renders both with one component. The rows a variant shows are the
latest elicitation day's, pooled, as the policy tab does.

The trend is metr_graph's ECI-tab projection at its defaults, read from
data/eci_trend_2026-08-21.json (code/make_eci_trend.py: the seeded replica
run once, daily, on the laptop -- the box that publishes has no numpy): a
monthly p25 / p50 / p75 curve for the chart, from the anchor day (the last
frontier point, where the projection starts) on, and the three values at
each variant's target date. Context for the chart, never something the model saw.

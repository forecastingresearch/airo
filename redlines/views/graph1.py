"""Graph 1: the bottom-line forecasts from the frontier ensemble.

Seven questions in two rail groups:

  crosscutting  general catastrophe, AI catastrophe, human disempowerment.
                Severity is fixed at 10% of population for the first two and
                absent for the third; only dates vary.
  incident      one EXPECTED-LOSS row per cause (since 2026-08-27): the
                eight rung forecasts folded to a floor on E[loss] in
                death-equivalents, the arithmetic the Conditional-on tab
                uses (redlines.conditional.expected_loss). The rungs
                themselves stay on Graph 2's severity ladder; here a cause
                is one row, not eight.

Featured questions are referenced, never copied. Duplicating one into the
cross-cutting file would get it elicited twice in the same call and put two
different numbers for one question into the coherence lattice. The 1M rung is
the one the workbook flags for human forecasting at every horizon, so it is the
only row where a model-versus-human read will exist across the whole time axis.

Every threshold this panel displays comes from questions.severity_label(), and
every horizon from questions.horizon_label(). None of it is typed into the page.

Human baselines carry their SOURCE. Before the swap all thirteen came from XPT
2022 and the panel printed that string as a constant; now only two questions
carry an anchor at all, and a third panel's number may arrive later, so the
label follows the data or it is wrong on five of the seven questions.

The two catastrophe questions now carry a `human` series each — a hollow
diamond per panel per horizon, superforecasters only (project lead, 2026-08-18:
report only supers everywhere), coloured from a muted reference palette and
labelled from the data (never a group name typed into the page). The other five
carry none. Turned on 2026-08-18 (project lead: they answer close but not
identical wordings, so they are drawn as a reference, with the mismatch stated
in humanCoverage.note, not reconciled here).

    the workbook's column and lives on the spec. Reading it off the rendered dicts
    silently returned nothing.

    Two facts, kept apart because they answer different questions. `wanted` is
    the workbook's "Human comparisons (Project)" column: which cells a prior FRI
    panel has answered, its author's judgement, not ours. `have` is what
    code/fetch_human_baselines.py could actually pull. A cell in `wanted` and
    not in `have` is a gap we should be able to name — P6 bio 2025 has numbers
    at 2045 and no question of ours to attach them to — and the page should say
    that rather than show a blank that reads as "nobody has forecast this".

    The series themselves ride on each question (`human`, built by
    _human_series); this is the coverage statement that names the gaps. Plotting
    was turned back on 2026-08-18 once the panels were pulled with their source
    wording attached — "add them back once we have ourselves sorted".

"""Graph 6 (causal conditionals): blob builder.

The StarSim causal bench -- data/causal/, the locked dataset of 2026-08-28
from the ForecastBench-Sim ICLR work (iclr-2026 repo, tag causal-v4-locked;
generating code frozen under code/causal/). One SIR population of 5,000
agents (starsim 3.3.4) with its parameters stated and its first twenty days
shown; a model forecasts the new infections by day 40 and day 60 as five
quantiles, once with no intervention and once given a day-21 vaccination
campaign of 25, 50 or 90% coverage, in SEPARATE prompts. Truth is the
simulator's own distribution over seeds matching the shown trajectory;
the score is CRPS skill against a fixed climatology (1 = the simulator's
distribution, 0 = climatology, below 0 = worse). Twenty-four models via
OpenRouter, vendor-default sampling, K = 3.

The chart is the dataset's headline figure: each model's intervention skill
pooled over the three coverage rungs, against ECI. The pooled numbers are
READ from the locked results/eci_vs_pooled.csv, never recomputed, and the
rank correlation and its p-value are recomputed here from that file
(redlines.stats.spearman_ties / spearman_p reproduce scipy's spearmanr;
tests/test_conditional_benches.py pins them to the README's rho=+0.68,
p=0.0003, n=23). Per-rung and baseline detail for the tooltips comes from the
per-rung score summaries. DeepSeek V4 Flash is partial in the dataset and
is excluded from the pooled figure, as the dataset's README excludes it.

Pure: build() reads its inputs and returns the blob dict; no writes.

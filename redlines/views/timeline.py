"""Timeline: how the bottom-line forecasts MOVE between elicitation dates.

Byte-exact port (2026-08-13) of the inline timeline script's build. Where Graph 1
(redlines/views/graph1.py) collapses the run log to each model's LATEST
forecast, this keeps the time axis: one snapshot per calendar date on which
forecasts were elicited, so the panel shows drift rather than a single
instant.

Grouping is by DATE, not run_id — a day's forecasts were appended in several
batches (the starter set, then the ladder), but they are one "as of" reading.

Feeds the Timeline panel, the lead of index.html's Forecasts tab
(web/demo/19-live-timeline.jsx; a standalone timeline.html until
2026-09-08): risk-category rail, horizon toggle, a dot per model per date
and the ensemble median over time.

THE SERIES STARTS AT redlines.runlog.SERIES_START (2026-09-02, the agentic
harness). Earlier elicitations -- the frontier five's batch, the joint
pilots, the 2026-08-28 three-draw pilot whose re-run bands the page used to
draw -- are a different method and are not spliced onto this line; they stay
in the run log and the CSV export. Everything below that pools a day's
draws still runs, and on a one-call-per-run series it is the identity:
`rerun`, `ci` and `noise` come out None and the page shows no bars.

The local forecasts_of() read guard from the inline timeline script is gone: every
row returned by redlines.runlog.load_runlog() already has "forecasts"
normalized to a (possibly empty) list of dicts (see that module's
docstring), so this module no longer needs to guard against a string or None
payload itself.

SHORT and per-question category now live in data/starter_questions.json
(migrated in 2026-08-13, see redlines/questions.py) instead of a local SHORT
dict.

REPLICATES (2026-08-28). A date's calls for one (question, model) are POOLED
by redlines.runlog.pool(): the plotted point is the mean of that day's draws,
`lo`/`hi` its min-max, and `draws` every raw value. The ensemble median is the
median of those per-model means, as before; `rerun` is its re-run interval --
the panel median recomputed once per draw index (all models' first draw, all
their second, ...) and spanned min-max -- and is None on any date with a
single draw per model, where there is no width to show. The old cross-model
min-max `spread` is gone: the model lines already show disagreement, and the
band's job is now to show how far the SAME models move when merely asked
again. The reason is in pool()'s docstring; the short form is that week-to-
week movement (median 0.8pp, p90 10pp) was no larger than same-day re-run
movement (median 0.6pp, p90 10pp), so a lone weekly draw was being read as
news it did not contain.

`noise` is that floor, measured from the log itself: on the latest date with
replicates, every pairwise |draw_i - draw_j| across (question, model,
horizon) cells, summarised as median / p90 / max. It is None until such a
date exists, and the page says nothing numeric about noise until then.

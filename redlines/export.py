"""The dataset behind the dashboard, as one CSV: every forecast from every
model in every run, unconditional and conditional alike.

One line per (call, question, horizon, condition). Unconditional rows come
from the published run log (redlines.runlog.load_runlog: results/runs/ plus
the legacy file), so the CSV's unconditional series is exactly the one the
panels draw; conditional rows come from the published instrument logs --
results/conditional_runs_combined.jsonl (the combined instrument, the
published set since 2026-08-28) and results/conditional_runs.jsonl (the
policy instrument before it) -- taking only the rows that carry a condition
(their unconditional siblings are already in the run log -- see
code/run_unified.py --joint, which writes each joint call to both), and only
the canonical panel's (redlines.runlog.panel_rows: the same rule the run log
applies, so the download shows exactly what the dashboard shows and nothing
of the models it replaced).

Two protocols appear, told apart by the `protocol` column: unified-joint-v1
(the single instrument, the published series since 2026-08-27) and its
predecessors (unified-batch-v2 unconditional runs; the 2026-08-27 separate-
call pilot for conditionals, experiment leap-wave12-pilot). They are not to
be pooled -- the joint unconditional runs about 2x lower than the same-day
separate call (docs/conditional-forecasts.md) -- which is why the column is
there.

Project lead, 2026-08-27: a big "download forecasts" button, all forecasts
from all models over all time. Built by `python3 -m redlines build --views csv`,
published beside index.html by code/publish_dashboard.sh.

A SECOND FILE, results/rationales.csv (2026-09-08; project lead: all
forecasts and rationales, including those from legacy models, must be
available): one line per (call, question, condition) -- the model's written
rationale for that question in that call, and the sources it cited -- from
the same rows as the forecasts file, joined on `call_id` + `question_id` +
`condition`. Separate because a rationale is per question per call while
the forecasts file is per horizon: repeating a 2,000-character rationale
on every horizon line would multiply the download several times over.

EVERYTHING (2026-09-08; project lead: include everything, even if it
requires a .zip). Both CSVs now carry every row the logs hold -- every
model that ever ran, panel or not, every instrument, every pilot -- with
`panel_set`/`panel_snapshot` columns so the dashboard's own view (panel
rows only) is one filter away, and `protocol`/`experiment` to tell the
elicitations apart. And results/redlines-data.zip (bundle_zip) wraps the
two CSVs with the raw JSONL logs verbatim (every search and page read the
models made), the retired per-question archive, the question set, the
condition sets, the ECI snapshots, and a README naming each. The Download
button serves the zip; the CSVs sit beside it for a quick look.

# ── the bundle: everything ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
LEGACY_DIR = RESULTS.parent / "archive" / "legacy-forecasts"
DATA_DIR = RESULTS.parent / "data"

BUNDLE_README = """# Redlines data bundle

Every forecast this project has elicited, with the models' rationales and the
raw logs behind them. Built by `python3 -m redlines build --views csv`
(redlines/export.py) at {built}.

## The two CSVs

forecasts.csv -- one line per (call, question, horizon, condition):
  {forecast_columns}

rationales.csv -- one line per (call, question, condition): the model's written
rationale for that question in that call, and the sources it named. Join to
forecasts.csv on call_id + question_id + condition.
  {rationale_columns}

Columns worth knowing:
- instrument_version: the question-definition version actually recorded on
  the row, or a documented protocol mapping. instrument_version_source
  distinguishes recorded, protocol-mapped and unknown. The published
  unified-joint-combined-v4 protocol maps to legacy-2026-08-31 and uses its
  archived question text. No other unstamped protocol receives that mapping.
  legacy-unversioned means no version was established; it does not
  imply that the row answered today's definitions. Current dashboard series
  include only airo-incidents-prospective-v1 and start anew at this change.
- question: the recorded question text, or the version-matched current
  specification. Blank on legacy rows whose exact wording was not recorded;
  archived definitions are supplied separately and must not be assumed to
  apply to every earlier run.
- run_date / onset_start / onset_end / onset_timezone / harm_years: the
  incident window actually sent, with inclusive UTC calendar dates. Only
  incidents beginning in that interval count; each contributes its first
  three years of harm, even beyond the onset deadline. Empty on older rows
  and on non-incident questions. Fixed-year windows advance with each run.
- prompt_sha256: identifies the exact joint prompt; its text is retained in
  raw JSONL on the first unconditional row of each new-version call.
- protocol: the elicitation. unified-joint-combined-v* is the single
  instrument (every question x horizon cell, unconditional and under every
  condition, in one call per model); unified-batch-v* the earlier plain
  batch; the pilots carry their own tags. Do not pool across protocols:
  the joint unconditional runs about 2x lower than the same-day separate
  call (docs/conditional-forecasts.md in the repo).
- panel_set / panel_snapshot: which model set the row's run asked, and the
  ECI snapshot that chose it. Empty = the hand-picked frontier five, before
  the panel existed (2026-08-28). The dashboard draws panel rows only
  (panel_set non-empty), narrowed to the current instrument version. The
  earlier series remains in this download and is not joined to the new one.
- experiment: non-empty on pilots and smokes -- not the published series.
- arm: which repeat of the call (joint#1, unconditional#2, ...).
- grounded: 1 if the call had web search; every published run does.

## raw/ -- the logs, verbatim (JSON lines)

raw/runs/*.jsonl              one file per scheduled run: the unconditional
                              slice of each call, one row per (call, question),
                              with the full tool transcript (every search
                              and page read) under `evidence`
raw/forecast_runs_unified.jsonl  the same series before 2026-08-21, one file
raw/conditional_runs*.jsonl   the whole instruments: every (call, question,
                              condition) row, same shape
raw/*_runs/*.jsonl            the capability-condition pilots' own logs
raw/experiments/              pilots and smokes -- NOT the published series
raw/legacy-forecasts/         the retired per-question protocol
                              (before 2026-08-14); see its README

## questions/ and conditions/

questions/autoarc_ladder.json and autoarc_crosscutting.json are the question
set (Bridget Williams, FRI); conditions/*.json the condition sets each
instrument asked under; conditions/epoch_capabilities_index_*.csv the ECI
snapshots the panel was chosen from.

questions/instruments/ retains archived generated questions and source
definitions. legacy-2026-08-31 is an archived specification, not a claim that
every unstamped older response used that wording. questions/sources/ contains
the dated source definitions, including earlier revisions.

"""Conditional forecasts: what a LEAP policy does to each question, per model.

Reads results/conditional_runs.jsonl -- the output of
`code/run_unified.py --condition ... --unconditional N` -- and turns it into
the one number the conditional panel plots: how far each model's forecast
moves under a policy, measured against ITS OWN same-session unconditional
forecast.

WHY THE BASELINE IS THE SAME-SESSION ARM, NOT THE WEEKLY SERIES
A conditional run made ten days after the weekly point mixes the policy's
effect with ten days of news. The experiment therefore carries its own
unconditional arms, elicited in the same session as the conditionals, and
those are the zero line. Several of them (--unconditional 3) give the
re-elicitation noise floor: a policy whose delta sits inside the spread of
three identical unconditional calls has not been shown to do anything.

WHY PER-MODEL, THEN ENSEMBLE
Baselines differ tenfold across models (Grok 12% vs Fable 1% on general
catastrophe at 2030). A delta of the ensemble medians would be dominated by
whichever model moved most in absolute terms. Each model's delta is taken
against its own baseline first; the ensemble figure is the median of those.

THREE MEASURES, ONE STORY
  delta_pp     p_cond - p_uncond, in percentage points. What a reader asks.
  ratio        p_cond / p_uncond. Readable on a ~1% baseline where pp is not,
               and the only one that also applies to an expected loss. The
               page plots this one, on a log axis so 1/2x and 2x are the same
               distance from the baseline.
  dlogit       logit(p_cond) - logit(p_uncond). Symmetric in raise/lower;
               kept in the summary for the record.

EXPECTED LOSS: THE LADDER COMPRESSED TO ONE NUMBER
Each cause's eight rungs are P(loss >= x_k) at log-spaced thresholds x_k
(100 deaths or $220M ... 1B deaths or $2.2Q). Those are points on a survival
function, and E[loss] = integral of S(x) dx. With S known only at the rungs,
the sum  sum_k S(x_k) (x_k - x_{k-1})  with x_0 = 0 is a FLOOR on E[loss]:
it values every band at its lower threshold and counts nothing above 1B
beyond 1B itself. The unit is death-equivalents at the ladder's own
exchange rate, 1 death = $2.2M since 2026-08-31 (the "or" in "100 deaths or
$220M"; $10M, "100 deaths or $1B", before). Because
the thresholds rise tenfold per rung, the top rungs dominate the sum; the
summary carries each cell's top-two-rung share so a reader can see how much
of "expected lives" is the 100M and 1B rungs. A non-monotone ladder (a
higher rung more likely than a lower one -- the batch prompt states no
relation between questions, so it can happen) is repaired by the running
minimum from the bottom, which keeps the floor a floor; the count of
repaired rungs is carried too.

Horizons default to 2030 and 2050. LEAP's conditioning clause keeps the
policy in force through 2050 and elicits its own outcome at 2050 only; a
2100 cell under that clause is a forecast under a policy the prompt does not
extend past 2050, so it is computed but flagged (`horizon_note`).

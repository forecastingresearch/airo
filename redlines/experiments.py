"""Experiments and the conditions they run.

A CONDITION is one configured way of running the instrument: the scenario
set it asks, the prompt variant, the instrument (minimal or standard), the
loop (harness), the models, a URL guard, and whether its rows publish. An
EXPERIMENT is a set of conditions with shared config, one TOML file under
experiments/: its top-level settings are every condition's, and a
condition's own table overrides any of them (2026-10-21; before that a
scenario set declared the variants it was asked under, and the shadow loop
and the axes instruments were each run their own way).

`pooled` names the conditions whose mean is each model's published number.
They run together: the mean is taken over one day's calls
(redlines.runlog.pool). A published condition outside `pooled` enters no
number and is never shown (2026-10-21); its rows stay in the run log and the
download. An unpublished one writes to results/experiments/ and nothing on
the page reads it.

A condition's CADENCE says when the cron runs it (2026-10-21): a list of
weekdays, UTC ("wed"), any of which may be an ordinal one ("1st wed", the
first Wednesday of the month), or "manual" for only when named by hand.
code/cron_run.sh asks `python -m redlines.experiments due` what is due
today and runs each group. The pooled conditions share one cadence, and a
published condition outside them runs only on days they run (a rule from
when the Timeline drew its line beside theirs, until 2026-10-21).

code/run_unified.py --experiment NAME runs an experiment's conditions (all
of them, or those named with --condition), whatever their cadence. Every row
a call writes carries the experiment's name, the condition's id, and condition_sha256, a hash of
the condition's settings, so two rows asked under different settings never
pass for the same condition.

Stdlib only (tomllib), like the rest of the build stage: the views read
experiments/airo.toml for what the published series asks.

"""Every coherence constraint the question set implies. No resolution needed.

The dashboard's questions form a lattice: some events strictly contain others, so
their probabilities are ordered whatever the world turns out to be. Each ordering
is checkable the day the forecast is made, which is what lets a protocol change
be judged rather than assumed (docs/coherence-experiment.md).

Lives in the package, not in code/, so tests/test_coherence.py can import it —
`code` is not a package and never will be. code/audit_coherence.py is the CLI
shim over this module.

Constraints:

  HORIZON    P must not fall as the horizon extends (cumulative questions).
  LADDER     Within a cause, P must not rise as the death threshold rises.
  CROSS      No specific cause may exceed "all causes" at the same threshold.
  BRACKET    A cross-cutting question sits at a death threshold on a ladder; its
             probability must sit on the correct side of that rung. The wording
             is not identical to the ladder's, so only the side the wording
             licenses is checked. The catastrophe questions resolve on 10% of
             population, so only the <=100M side of the bracket is licensed.
  SUBSET     One question's event is contained in another's: an AI-related
             epidemic is one kind of AI-related incident, 100k deaths is a
             subset of 1k deaths.

NONE of these hold by construction any more. Under unified-batch-v1 the prompt
stated the first three, so a clean HORIZON row measured compliance with an
instruction rather than the model's own coherence. The constraint block left the
prompt on 2026-08-18 (unified-batch-v2), which is what makes every row here a
measurement. Rows carrying the v1 tag are a different arm and must not be pooled
with v2 rows — tests/test_coherence.py warns when both are present.

# THE BOX'S CODE (2026-10-21): bring this checkout up to its upstream branch
# before a scheduled job runs from it, so what is merged is what runs --
# deploying is merging. The crontab runs it ahead of each job, holding the
# OTHER job's lock so code never changes under a running one:
#
#   0 12 * * 3,5 flock -n /tmp/redlines-forecast.lock bash -c 'flock -n /tmp/fb-round.lock <airo>/code/pull.sh; exec <airo>/code/cron_run.sh'
#   5 0 25 10 *  flock -n /tmp/fb-round.lock bash -c 'flock -n /tmp/redlines-forecast.lock <airo>/code/pull.sh; exec <repo>/submissions/forecastbench/scripts/fb_cron.sh 2026-10-25'
#
# Fast-forward only. The runs rewrite some tracked files in place: the
# dashboard's index.html and results/*.json, and the scenario sets
# data/*_conditions.json. Where the incoming commits change one of those too,
# the box's copy goes to ~/backups/airo-pull-<stamp>/ and the incoming one is
# taken; the next AIRO run rebuilds it from the box's own rows (the served
# page, /var/www/html, is untouched until then). Anything else in the way --
# another file modified here, a commit only here, an untracked file the pull
# would overwrite -- stops the pull and pages, and the job runs the checkout
# as it is. A pull that changes a dependency manifest pages too: the venv and
# pi are not reinstalled here. One line per pull goes to ~/logs/pull.log.

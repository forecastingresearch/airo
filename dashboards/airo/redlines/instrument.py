"""Question-version boundaries and dated incident onset windows.

The joint call changes as a whole even though only the incident definitions
changed. Old responses are retained, never inferred to answer the new rules.

Versions, newest first (each one's generated question set is archived under
data/instruments/<version>/ when the next replaces it):

                                 equivalent morbidity) and one on economic
                                 damages, instead of one deaths-OR-damages

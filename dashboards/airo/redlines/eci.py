"""redlines.eci -- AIRO's binding of the Epoch Capabilities Index.

The implementation -- fetch, the three snapshot formats, ranking, the
frontier history, staleness -- is fri_forecaster.eci in this repository
(packages/forecaster), shared with the ForecastBench rounds since
2026-10-19; until then this module carried its own copy. What is AIRO's:

  SNAPSHOT_DIR   data/epoch_capabilities_index_YYYY-MM-DD.csv, tracked, so a
                 run's panel is reproducible from the checkout. Nothing is
                 hand-copied (docs/model-set.md): code/cron_run.sh fetches a
                 snapshot before every elicitation.
  PINNED         the vintage Graph 4's capability-vs-skill ladder was built
                 on. Refreshing it moves every tracked artifact, so it is a
                 deliberate, separate change (re-baseline tests/), not
                 something a newer file in data/ does on its own.
  SUPPLEMENT     the snapshot the registry's per-model `eci` comes from for
                 models PINNED predates (Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Sol, Fable 5.1,
                 GPT-6 Astra); only a model neither file has falls through
                 to latest(). Frozen 2026-10-01, when the snapshot started
                 being fetched before every run: Graph 4 draws two of those
                 models, and its x-axis must not move with the panel's index.
  latest()       the newest snapshot by date in the filename. This is what
                 the MODEL PANEL is selected from (redlines.registry.panel):
                 the k highest-ECI models the registry can run. A panel picked
                 from a stale index is a stale panel, so anything that selects
                 from latest() checks its age and WARNs past STALE_AFTER_DAYS.

    python3 -m redlines.eci          # snapshots, age, the current top of the index
    python3 -m redlines.eci --fetch  # code/cron_run.sh, before every elicitation

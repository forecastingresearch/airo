#
# The machine's settings come from ~/.config/fri-forecaster/round.env (or
# $FORECASTER_ROUND_ENV), sourced with every variable exported; see
# examples/round.env.example. The team's names (FB_ORG, the anonymous one every
# set goes up under; FB_PUBLIC_ORG, its own, for the one condition the registry
# marks public) and the name registry (FORECASTER_NAMES) are private: they live
# there, never in the repo. API keys only, from FORECASTER_ENV_FILE: pi gets
# its own agent dir, never a login.
# Writes $ROUNDS_DIR/<due>[-<tag>]/ and a one-screen summary.txt there.
#
# The conditions run in the registry's order, the submitted ones first, each
# built as soon as its members are in: put the one that matters most first, so
# a round that runs out of day has it. A second pass asks again what the first
# left unanswered and builds each set for good.

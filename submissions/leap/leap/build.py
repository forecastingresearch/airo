"""Pool the members and write the submission file.

The system's forecast for a value is the equal-weight mean of the members'
values (a mean of percentiles keeps them in order, and a mean of shares that
each sum to 100 still sums to 100). Every member must have every entry: a
partial ensemble is a different system, so the build refuses one unless told
--allow-partial, and then says which values rest on fewer members.

The file is named <model>.<question_set>.json and is checked with the
organisers' validator before the build reports success.

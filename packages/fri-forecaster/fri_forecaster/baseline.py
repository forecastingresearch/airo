"""The Baseline condition: how a dashboard asks the panel.

One call per panel member (fri_forecaster.panel), with nothing in it but the
dashboard's own prompt:

  no system prompt      one space, because pi puts its own coding-assistant
                        prompt in place of an empty one.
  research is offered,  web_search and read_page (Tavily, tools.py), described
  never required        by what they do; no research floor, no coverage rule.
  no debrief            the call ends with the answer.
  reasoning at the top  panel.reasoning_for.
  a turn limit of 100   a runaway guard far above any call seen (64 turns); it
                        also keeps the harness's nudge on, so a reply cut at
                        the output limit with no submission does not end the
                        call.

This is AIRO's published condition `none` (its minimal instrument,
combined-v10, 2026-10-19: the prompt-variant experiments of 2026-10-14..19
found the instrument's guidance moved no headline forecast), labelled
"Baseline" on its dashboard. AIRO's runner reads the constants below, so the
two cannot drift; a dashboard that asks something other than probabilities
calls run() with its own answer schema.

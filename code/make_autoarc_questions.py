"""Generate the question sets from the Auto-ARC source files. THE source of truth.

Project lead, 2026-08-17: the data source that hydrates all of the language on
the dashboard must be the same one that hydrates what the superforecasters were
asked and what the models are asked, so the two can never come apart.

This script is what makes that true. Everything downstream — the model prompt,
the graph titles, the axis labels, the modal, the data bank, the coherence
relations — reads the JSON this writes, and this reads only the two source files
under data/auto-arc/. Nothing is hand-typed twice.

WHY THAT MATTERS, CONCRETELY. Before this existed the dashboard's headline read
"Catastrophic = >= 10 million deaths (or >= $1T economic damage)", typed into
web/demo/80-app.jsx, while the question it labelled asked about 10% of humans
alive — about 820 million. Off by a factor of eighty, in the headline, for as
long as anyone had looked. It was caught on the call, by eye. Prose that is not
generated from the question data will drift from it; the only fix that holds is
to stop writing it by hand.

    python3 code/make_autoarc_questions.py            # write both files
    python3 code/make_autoarc_questions.py --check    # verify, write nothing

--check is what tests/test_autoarc_generator.py runs: regenerate in memory and
compare byte-for-byte against what is tracked. A hand edit to either JSON file
fails the build, which is the property "no way for them to become disentangled"
expressed as something a machine can enforce.

INPUTS (vendored, so a rebuild needs no network and no path outside the repo)
  data/auto-arc/questions-<date>.xlsx     composition: which question x severity
                                          x horizon cells exist. Sheet
                                          "Auto-ARC questions - long" is the
                                          authority; the summary sheet is a
                                          human-readable digest of it.
  data/auto-arc/definitions-<date>.md     the definitions and resolution
                                          criteria, parsed by section heading.
                                          the author's prose is used verbatim —
                                          never re-typed here — so a wording
                                          change lands by replacing the file.

OUTPUTS
  data/autoarc_crosscutting.json   general catastrophe, AI catastrophe, human
                                   disempowerment. Severity does not vary; only
                                   dates do (project lead, 2026-08-18). So these are
                                   three questions, not a ladder.
  data/autoarc_ladder.json         the 4 x 8 incident grid, plus causes, rungs,
                                   the coherence relations, and the ids Graph 1
                                   features.

# ── rolling near-term horizons ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# The paper's lead author, 2026-08-17: the set also needs near-term horizons --
# the next year, the next six months -- because part of the idea is a dashboard
# that shows when the very near-term risk is suddenly elevated.
#
# ROLLING (project lead, 2026-08-18): the window moves with the run date, because
# the level is the signal and a fixed date decays toward certainty as it nears.
# Each run stamps an ABSOLUTE resolves_on so a rolling forecast can still be
# found and scored later — that is the whole reason these are worth asking. They
# are the only cells in the set that resolve inside the paper's life.
#
# Applied to the WHOLE set since 2026-08-28 (project lead: re-elicit the
# cross-cutting ones at shorter durations for consistency). Until then the three
# were asked at 2030/2050/2100 only, on the reasoning that P(10% of humanity dies
# within six months) is noise and the near-term signal lives on the incident ladder.
# That kept Graph 1's two rail groups on different x-axes: four expected-loss
# rows spanning 6mo..2100 beside three catastrophe panels starting at 2030, which
# cannot be read against each other at the near end. Expect the near-term
# cross-cutting points to be round-number floors; they are a tripwire (does the
# level MOVE?), not a level worth reading on its own.

    """No human anchors today. The XPT medians were pulled on 2026-08-18.

    They had been attached to catastrophe:general and catastrophe:ai on the
    grounds that XPT 2022 asked "the SAME 10%-of-population threshold and the
    same three horizons, so those medians transfer without adjustment". The
    threshold and the horizons do match. Three things under them do not:

      window       XPT: deaths "within a 5-year period". Auto-ARC: "any
                   contiguous period of AT MOST five years", which must begin
                   on or after 2025-12-31. Ours is a ceiling with a floor on
                   the start date; XPT's was neither.
      what counts  XPT counted humans who "die". Auto-ARC counts ATTRIBUTABLE
                   EXCESS MORTALITY -- deaths beyond the baseline that would
                   have occurred anyway. A pandemic killing 10% of the world
                   resolves both; a famine that raises mortality against a
                   falling baseline may resolve only one.
      causation    All three run the same but-for test, and this was written
                   here as a difference when it is not. What DOES differ is the
                   clock: XPT and LEAP both require the AI's substantial
                   involvement "within one year prior to the event"; Auto-ARC
                   sets no time limit and says so, counting a superweapon built
                   years before it is used. Ours is the wider question.

    Plotting them as diamonds beside our forecasts asserted a comparison that
    the wordings do not support (project lead, 2026-08-18: they do not match our
    questions exactly). The numbers are not lost -- they are in
    archive/legacy-questions/starter_questions.json under "9. Total
    Catastrophic Risk" and "3. AI Catastrophic Risk", with the XPT wording
    beside them, which is where anyone re-deriving an adjusted anchor should
    start.

    What would restore an anchor here: the September superforecaster round,
    which is being asked BRIDGET'S wording and so needs no adjustment at all;
    or LEAP 2026 / P6-bio 2025 once we hold their numbers and can state what
    reconciliation each one needs.

The FRI economist's spec of 2026-09-02 (designed the same day). Each set is one
call per model: every question x horizon cell (2030, 2050 and 2100 only --
`horizons`) answered unconditionally and under every level of every axis,
never two axes at once; and, first, the model's own forecast of each axis
quantity in the percentiles LEAP asked its panel for, so the scatter can
overlay where the model itself expects the world to be beside where the
superforecasters do.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS AUTHORED

  derived    every LEAP question's text, background, resolution criteria and
             unit, verbatim from data/leap/axes-<date>.json (code/
             pull_leap_axes.py, the FRI warehouse), less markdown bold and
             italic markers; the levels (below); the ECI definitions and
             frontier history (code/make_eci_self_conditions.py).
  authored   the fact-learned conditioning instruction per axis, the
             one-line standalone rule, each section's assumption about the
             other axes, the elicitation sentences (which name LEAP's
             percentiles), the labels, and each level's tolerance. Same
             discipline as every other set: nothing about how any axis
             relates to any question, no direction, no pace verdict.

THE LEVELS -- from first principles (project lead, 2026-09-02: not numbers said
in a meeting). A level means something only relative to a reference
distribution, so each axis takes its levels from one:

  LEAP axes  the superforecasters' answer -- for each percentile LEAP asked
             (p10/p50/p90, or p5..p95), the median across superforecasters
             of that percentile. Where LEAP asked three percentiles the set
             adds one level below and one above by repeating the adjacent
             step (multiplicative for a magnitude, additive for a rate), so
             every axis has five levels and the outer two are outside the
             panel's 10-90 (or 25-75) range.
  eci        the trend (data/eci_trend_<date>.json, metr_graph's fit): the
             frontier's fitted level at the anchor plus a multiple of the
             fitted pace over the interval to the reference target date --
             0x (the frontier stalls), 0.5x, 1x (trend), 1.5x, 2x, 3x. Six
             levels; the chart labels them by pace, the model sees numbers.

  Rounding: magnitudes to two significant figures, rates to a tenth, years
  and ECI points to the integer. The prompt shows the number and a
  tolerance; the percentile or pace it came from is in `chart`, never shown.

The levels are FIXED in the file and identical every week, so the scatter
is comparable across runs; they are re-derived (and the protocol tag bumped)
only when the reference moves -- a new LEAP wave, or a new ECI snapshot past
redlines.eci's staleness warning. The ECI target date rolls with the run
(run date + 6 months, run_unified.resolve_set) while its levels do not; the
reference run date they were computed for is recorded under `reference`.

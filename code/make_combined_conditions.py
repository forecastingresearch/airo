"""Generate data/combined_conditions.json: ONE survey instrument that carries
both the LEAP Wave 12 policy conditions and the self-elicited six-month
capability conditions -- side by side, never crossed.

Project lead, 2026-08-28: one survey instrument should cover both the
capability and the policy conditions -- not policy x capability, but the two
kept separate: policy questions assuming the median ECI trajectory,
capability questions assuming "whatever the unconditional policy is". This
file is that instrument. One call per model answers every
question x horizon cell fourteen times: unconditionally, under each of the
eight LEAP policies, and under each of the model's own five capability
percentiles -- 210 x 14 = 2,940 probabilities, against 1,890 on the policy
instrument and 1,260 on the capability one.

    python3 code/make_combined_conditions.py           # writes data/combined_conditions.json
    python3 code/make_combined_conditions.py --check    # verify the file is current

WHAT IS COMPOSED AND WHAT IS AUTHORED

  composed   everything the two component sets say, verbatim: LEAP's
             conditioning instruction, frontier-model definition, horizon
             line and all eight policy items (data/leap_policies.json), and
             the capability set's ECI definitions and frontier history, its
             Step-1 elicitation, its fact-learned instruction, horizon line
             and five own-percentile items (data/eci_self6mo_conditions.json).
             The runner renders each item through the same template as the
             component instrument, so a policy's text inside this block is
             byte-identical to its text in the policy instrument
             (tests/test_conditional.py::TestCombinedSet).
  authored   four sentences, and only these: the one-line rule that every
             condition stands alone (conditioning.instruction), the merged
             unconditional line (conditioning.unconditional_forecast), and
             each group's `assumption` -- what that group holds the OTHER
             group's quantity at. Same discipline as every other set:
             nothing about how a policy or a capability level relates to any
             question, no direction, no pace verdict.

THE TWO ASSUMPTIONS, which are the whole design:

  policy       every policy condition sits on the model's own MEDIAN
               capability trajectory -- the frontier ECI on the target date
               is its 50th percentile from eci_forecast, the same level as
               condition eci_p50. LEAP's clause already says "hold other
               factors constant"; this says what constant means for
               capability. The like-for-like baseline for a policy delta is
               therefore eci_p50 rather than the unconditional; on 2026-08-28
               every model's own-median world reproduced its unconditional to
               0.98-1.00x, so the two baselines agree to within noise, and
               the tabs keep reading deltas against the unconditional.
  capability   no policy condition applies: the model assumes whatever AI
               policies it expects to be implemented, as in its unconditional
               forecast. The capability instruction is still the fact-learned
               one (update everything that would accompany that level,
               "how governments and developers respond" included) -- so the
               expected policy response to a capability level is part of the
               world, not held fixed. That is the reading of "whatever the
               unconditional policy is" that keeps the capability set as
               its designer intended; the alternative (freeze policy at the
               unconditional expectation) would contradict that instruction
               and is not what this file says.

The target date is rolling, as in the six-month set: `{target_date}` is
filled by run_unified.resolve_set at run time (run date + 6 months) in every
text here, the group assumptions included.

Protocol tag `unified-joint-combined-v1`: a different instrument from the
policy one (`unified-joint-v*`) and the capability one
(`unified-joint-eciself6mo-v1`), so its unconditional slice is its own
series -- an unconditional answered beside thirteen conditions and an ECI
forecast is not the one answered beside eight policies. Piloted 2026-08-28
into results/combined_runs/; THE PUBLISHED SET since that evening (project
lead: the dashboard shows the panel on the single instrument): the runner
writes its unconditional slice to results/runs/ and the instrument to
results/conditional_runs_combined.jsonl, and the cron runs it.

v1 -> v2 on 2026-09-02: THE AGENTIC HARNESS. The questions and conditions in
this file did not change; what changed is how the models are asked -- the
Metaculus lookup left the toolset, a page reader joined it, the prompt asks
for iterative multi-step search instead of one pass and the loop enforces a
research floor before submit_forecast is offered (code/run_unified.py
SYSTEM / PROMPT_JOINT / MIN_RESEARCH, redlines/tools.py, redlines/llm.py),
reasoning runs at each provider's top rung (redlines.llm.REASONING), and the
cron elicits once instead of five times. A forecast gathered that way is a different elicitation from
one gathered the old way, and the tag is how a reader tells them apart; the
tabs show the newest tag present and fall back to v1 until a v2 run lands
(redlines.conditional.PROTOCOL_LINEAGE).

v3 -> v4 on 2026-09-03: FIVE CAPABILITY CONDITIONS. The model's own 10th and
90th percentiles join the 25th/50th/75th as conditions (project lead: condition
on the 10th and 90th percentiles too, now that they are elicited).
The elicitation was already five percentiles; the instrument now asks a
question in each of those five worlds -- 210 x 14 = 2,940 probabilities a
call. First cron run under v4: Friday 2026-09-04.

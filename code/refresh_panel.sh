# THE PANEL, REFRESHED (2026-10-21): fetch Epoch's index, give a registry row
# to any model it now ranks into the panel without one, rebuild the capability
# scenarios from the new snapshot, and page what changed. Every job on the box
# that reads the panel runs this first -- code/cron_run.sh before each AIRO run,
# and the ForecastBench rounds (round.env's panel_members hook, see
# packages/fri-forecaster/examples/round.env.example) -- so the panel is never
# older than the job reading it, and whichever job fetches a change first is
# the one that pages it. Until 2026-10-21 this was inline in cron_run.sh, and a
# round that fetched on its own left the next AIRO run nothing to page.
#
# Prints what it did; exits non-zero only when the panel cannot be read or the
# scenarios cannot be rebuilt. A failed fetch keeps the previous snapshot and
# pages; the runner's preflight (code/check_eci_snapshot.py) still refuses one
# older than 21 days.

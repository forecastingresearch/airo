"""Why Graph 3 stays on one ForecastBench round.

THE QUESTION
    Graph 3 draws superforecasters against 2024-era LLMs on the 2024-07-21
    round. The obvious ask (2026-08-10 call) is to add 2025 and 2026 model
    lines so the curve visibly walks toward the diagonal. This script measures
    whether that comparison would mean anything.

THE PROBLEM
    Three things differ between the 2024 line and any later line, and the chart
    would attribute all of it to model capability:

      1. PROMPT CONFIG. `scratchpad_with_news` exists ONLY in 2024-07-21.
         Rounds through 2025-08-31 carry `scratchpad`; from 2025-10-26 on the
         benchmark runs `zero_shot` only.
      2. ROUND. Each round is a fresh question set. Recent rounds have also had
         less time to resolve, so their resolved rows collapse onto the short
         horizons — 2026-02-15 resolves 192 of 205 rows at 7 days, against a
         balanced 7/30/90/180/365 in 2024. Short horizons are easier.
      3. MODEL VINTAGE. The effect we actually want to show.

    ForecastBench re-runs some models every round, which hands us the control
    for free: a FIXED model's score change across rounds is pure round effect.

WHAT IT FINDS (see docs/methodology.md for the write-up)
    Config effect      ~0.002 Brier   negligible — all three configs agree
    Round effect       ~0.035 Brier   a fixed model, swinging on question luck
    Vintage effect     ~0.013 Brier   replicated in three independent rounds

    The confound is about 3x the signal, so a cross-round Graph 3 would show
    benchmark difficulty and label it progress.

    THE NUMBERS MOVE AS THE BENCHMARK RESOLVES. Re-run this before citing it.
    On the 2026-03-05 data snapshot the vintage effect measured 0.003; the
    2026-08-11 refresh — which resolved the long horizons on eleven more rounds
    — put it at 0.013. The conclusion held, but the margin narrowed from 10x to
    3x. The tightest check is section 5: consecutive versions of the same model
    from the same lab, and two of the four went backwards.

    Refresh the data first (it is NOT in the git repo — the repo tracks only
    question and resolution sets):

        curl -L -o pfs.tar.gz \\
          https://www.forecastbench.org/assets/data/processed-forecast-sets/processed_forecast_sets.tar.gz

    then extract over ~/Projects/forecastbench-datasets/processed_forecast_sets/
    and run:

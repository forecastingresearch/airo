"""THE forecast runner: one call per model, every question, every horizon.

This replaces the per-question elicitation in code/run_forecasts.py. The
evidence is in docs/coherence-experiment.md; the short version:

  - asked one question per call, 46% of severity ladders come back incoherent
    (P rising as the death threshold rises), and 4.5% of cause/total pairs put a
    specific cause above "all causes"
  - asked all rungs of one cause per call, within-ladder violations go to ZERO
    but 0.6% of cross-cause pairs still break
  - asked ALL causes in one call, both go to zero, and the ">=99% pinned rung"
    count drops from 20 to 13
  - on FreeCiv chains, which resolve, batching also improves Brier
    (median -0.0073 per chain, p = 0.010) — so it is not buying tidiness with
    accuracy

So the unit of elicitation is THE WHOLE QUESTION SET. Every question the
dashboard plots is answered in one context, which is what makes the panels
mutually consistent instead of separately plausible.

THE PROMPT STATES NO RELATION BETWEEN THE QUESTIONS, AND MUST NOT (2026-08-18).
Shared context is the whole treatment; coherence is a MEASUREMENT taken after
the fact by redlines/coherence.py, never something the prompt buys. Nick told
the 2026-08-17 project call, verbatim: "nothing is being forced ... we do not
suggest in prompts that it should be, and we do not throw out results that do
not cohere." Until this change that was false — PROMPT carried a four-line
"your numbers must respect the logical relations" block, so every coherence
number the dashboard reported was contaminated by it.

What the evidence licenses, and where this goes past it: the ladder experiment's
arm C (joint + the monotonicity rule) beat arm B (joint, no rule) by nothing at
all, 0.0% violations either way, which is why docs/coherence-experiment.md's own
conclusion reads "Do not state the constraint." That covers the ladder, cross-
cause and subset lines. It does NOT cover the horizon line: arm B carried
"probabilities must be non-decreasing across horizons" too, so that constraint
was never run un-instructed and its 0.0% rate was manufactured — as
tests/test_coherence.py admitted in a comment, "(prompt-enforced both ways)".
Removing it as well is a deliberate step past the experiment, taken because a
rate the prompt dictated is not a rate worth publishing. Expect HORIZON to stop
reading zero. That is the measurement working, not a regression.

tests/test_coherence.py::test_prompt_states_no_constraint guards this file
against a quiet re-instruction.

Composition (Auto-ARC set, 2026-08-18):
  - the four incident causes, each spanning all eight severity rungs
  - the three cross-cutting questions as their own group; they belong to no
    cause, because a catastrophe at 10% of population is not a rung of any
    incident type
  - EXCLUDED: config.UNBATCHED (the P6-bio comparison rows, which sit at 2045 on
    a deaths-only severity and share neither grid)

Each question carries its own RESOLUTION CRITERIA into the prompt. Bridget's
definitions hold the measurement window, the but-for standard, what counts as
excess mortality, the QALY conversion and the value of a statistical life
— none of it stated in the question text, all of it changing the answer. The
retired set had no criteria to send, so this is new.

Horizons come from the SPEC, not from whichever question sorts first, because
the set has questions on different grids. Two of them are ROLLING (6mo, 12mo):
they move with the run date, so every row stamps `resolves_on` and `run_date`.
Without that a rolling forecast cannot be found or scored later, and two runs a
month apart would both say "6mo" and mean different weeks.

Output rows use the SAME schema as results/forecast_runs.jsonl — one row per
(question_id, model) — so every view, both pages and both golden tests read it
unchanged. Batch provenance rides along in extra fields.

Run with any interpreter that has the acquisition extra installed
(`pip install -e '.[acquire]'` — it pulls in litellm, the only third-party
dependency the runners need; `python3 -m redlines build` still needs none):

# default 3) give the noise, on the conditionals as well as the unconditional.

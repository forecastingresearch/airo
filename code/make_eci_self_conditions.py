"""Generate data/eci_self_conditions.json: the SELF-ELICITED capability
instrument -- the model forecasts the frontier ECI at end of 2030 itself
(10th / 25th / 50th / 75th / 90th percentiles), then answers every cell
conditional on each of its own five values.

Designed 2026-08-28 (project lead). The fixed set (data/eci_conditions.json) hands
the model three levels from metr_graph's projection; this one asks the model
for its own distribution first, from the vendored Epoch history, and
conditions on that. Two things come out that the fixed set cannot give:
the model's ECI forecast against the trend projection's, and whether asking
for it moves the unconditional.

    python3 code/make_eci_self_conditions.py           # writes data/eci_self_conditions.json (end of 2030)
    python3 code/make_eci_self_conditions.py --check    # verify the file is current
    python3 code/make_eci_self_conditions.py --months 6 --out data/eci_self6mo_conditions.json [--check]
                                                       # the ROLLING variant: six months from the run date

THE ROLLING VARIANT (--months N; project lead, 2026-08-28: six months from the
run date, generated into the prompt at run time). The target is not a
fixed date but run date + N months, so the file carries the texts with a
`{target_date}` placeholder and `elicit.target_months`; the runner resolves
the date when it builds the prompt (run_unified.resolve_set, the same
month arithmetic as the rolling horizons' resolves_on) and stamps it on
every row (`elicited.target_date`). The trend to compare against is then
computed at analysis time for that date (code/analyze_eci_self.py via
code/eci_projection_metrgraph.project), so the file has no `trend` block.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS AUTHORED

  derived    the frontier history the model is shown -- every new high among
             US developers' models since GPT-4, best variant per model,
             looked up in the vendored Epoch CSV -- and, for the record, the
             metr_graph 2030-EOY percentiles the answers are compared to
             (never shown to the model).
  authored   the definitions, the two steps, the conditioning instruction,
             the unconditional line, ids and labels. Same discipline as the
             other sets: nothing about how capability relates to any
             question, nothing about direction, no pace verdict.

The conditions are keyed by percentile, not by level: `eci_p25` is "the
frontier ECI on 2030-12-31 is approximately the 25th-percentile value YOU
gave". The level therefore differs per call, and the runner stamps each
condition row with the value the model gave (condition.value).

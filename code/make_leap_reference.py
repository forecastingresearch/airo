"""data/leap/axes-<date>.json (internal) -> data/leap_reference.json (tracked).

The LEAP survey material under data/leap/ is internal to FRI and is not
published: the survey documents, the full per-panel answer distributions, and
questions the dashboard never shows. The dashboard does show one thing from
it -- for a handful of questions, each panel's n and the median across
panelists of each percentile asked -- as the reference lines on the axes and
capability panels. This script extracts exactly that into a tracked file, so
a public clone builds the page without the internal source, and the internal
source is needed only to regenerate the extract.

    python3 code/make_leap_reference.py            # write data/leap_reference.json
    python3 code/make_leap_reference.py --check    # verify the tracked extract is current
